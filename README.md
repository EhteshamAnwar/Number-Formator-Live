# Number Formator Live

This mini project is a real-time number formatter that supports both the Metric number system and the European number system. The application dynamically updates formatted numbers as the user inputs them, allowing for immediate conversion and presentation according to the selected format.

## Project Overview

The **Number Formator Live** project was designed to simplify the display and formatting of numbers in two widely used systems:

1. **Metric Number System**: This system follows conventions used in many countries globally, focusing on clear formatting for large and small numbers using decimal points and standard grouping.
  
2. **European Number System**: In this system, numbers are formatted using commas as decimal points and periods for grouping, commonly used in various European regions.

The project offers an intuitive and responsive interface where users can switch between these systems and see the results instantly. This makes it ideal for international applications or user interfaces that need to adapt to different formatting conventions based on locale.
